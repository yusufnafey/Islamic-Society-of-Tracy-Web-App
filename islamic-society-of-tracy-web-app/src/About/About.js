        <div className="container">
            <p>The Islamic Society of Tracy (ISOT) is a federally registered non-profit organization under Section 501 (C) (3) Internal Revenue Code.  Located in the City of Tracy, it is an independent organization and does not have any affiliation or association with any other political or non-political organizations, parties, institutes, or establishments.</p>
            <p>Friday Prayers as well as five daily prayers are performed at masjid.  These gatherings give our community members a chance to meet with each other and exchange ideas on how to promote, maintain, and preserve our shared Islamic beliefs, attitudes, values, tradition, and heritage, which characterize us.</p>
            <p>The ISOT offers daily classes in teaching our members and their children the Holly Quran, Fiqh, Arabic Language, and Islamic studies.  We have also Family Nights Programs, which bring Muslim families closer in this area.  We invite excellent speakers to discuss selected Islamic subjects in detail.</p>
            <p>The ISOT welcomes all Muslims of this area, no matter what their origins or nationalities are, to participate in the day-to-day services and activities of the Masjid.</p>

        <div className="titles">Imam</div>
        <div className="container">
            <p>Lateef Ur Rahman was born and raised in Stockton, California. For his love of Deen, he traveled abroad to Pakistan to acquire sacred Islamic knowledge. Upon completing the memorization of the Holy Qur’an, he advanced his study of Islamic Sciences at the acclaimed Darul Uloom Karachi. After finishing a rigorous curriculum under the honored Mufti Taqi Usmani, he received a Masters equivalent in Islamic Theology. His studies resulted in numerous formal Islamic authorizations (ijazahs) such as Arabic language and literature, Fiqh, Tafsir, Hadith, and Aqidah. After graduating in 2004, he returned to the United States to spread his knowledge.</p>
            <p>Since 2006, Imam Lateef has been serving as the Imam and Director of Religious Services at Islamic Society of Tracy. Imam Lateef has dedicated himself to teaching and benefitting the community with what he had mastered abroad. He currently teaches weekday Qur'an classes, as well as Saturday Qur’an and Islamic classes. In addition to being an Imam, father, and teacher, he also is a prominent member of the Islamic Sharia Council of California, which serves to fulfill the religious needs of communities nationwide. Imam Lateef leads a group for Hajj every year and is often invited to speak at programs, gatherings, marriages, and religious events. He currently resides in Stockton, California with his wife and three children.</p>
